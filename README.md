# NIDS
A Network Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), or Network Based IDS, is security hardware that is placed strategically to monitor critical network traffic. Traditional Network Based IDS analyzes passing network traffic and matches that traffic to a library of known attacks in its system. Newer systems use artificial intelligence (aka heuristics) to analyze traffic for patterns of interest.  When an attack is identified, or a pattern of interest is found, an alert is sent typically to a Security Operations Center (aka: SOC) who review the alert and triage it for validity and subsequent escalation.​

REAL TIME USAGE
The growing prevalence of network attacks is a well-known problem which can impact the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of critical information for both individuals and enterprises. In recent years, due to the rapid growth in network technology, numerous types of intrusions have been uncovered that differ from the existing ones, and the conventional firewalls with specific rule sets and policies are incapable of identifying those intrusions in real-time. Therefore, that demands the requirement of a network-based intrusion detection system.​

Our research will show the difference between different classification algorithms and propose the pros and cons of using them, which might come handy while setting up any network-based intrusion detection system.​
